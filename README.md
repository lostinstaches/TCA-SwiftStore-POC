## Description ðŸš€

Welcome to the toy repo with an example of using SwiftStore to handle multiple root screens in the app powered by SCA.
A very light app creates still a very laggy behavior.

Everything that is important to handling these screeens in the `AppFeature` package. (`AppVeiw` and `AppReducer`).

## Showcase of lagging behavior.
